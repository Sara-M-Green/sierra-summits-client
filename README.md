## Summary

Sierra Summits is a web application designed for peak baggers of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range. The Sierra Peaks Section (SPS) has named 247 peaks throughout the range. This app allows users to find and filter peaks based on mileage, elevation gain, and/or class.

After applying filters, thumbnails of all peaks that meet the criteria will be displayed on the webpage. Each thumbnail will provide a link to further details on the peak including GPS coordinates, trailhead information, a photo and a route overview. 

Each peak also contains an online summit register. Similar to a physical summit register found at the top of each of these peaks, users can sign the online summit register. Users may sign in note that they completed the climb to the summit, or to notify other users on trail conditions.
