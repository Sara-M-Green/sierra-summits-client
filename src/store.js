            location: "36.12750°N / 118.20778°W",
            overview: "Smith Mountain is on the Kern Plateau, near Kennedy Meadows. The highpoint of about half dozen small peaks in the area surrounded by pine forests and lush meadows, Smith is probably the most climbed of the lot. The peak is mostly tree covered, but the summit is topped by a small granite formation that requires some class II scrambling on excellent rock covered with pretty lichen.",
            route: "From the parking area, walk up old logging road about 3/4 mile to where it crosses a motorcycle trail, Turn right and follow it a short distance (couple hundred yards), then leave the trail to the left and cross-country up the tree covered ridge of Smith Mountain. There are some cairns but no trail. It's an easy hike, about 3 miles roundtrip.",

There are no maintained trails up English, but the landscape is a mix of open piney woods, low brush and boulder fields – you can walk almost anywhere you want.",

            summit: 7429,
            location: "35.79200°N / 118.0436°W",
            overview: "Lamont Peak is the striking, pinnacled ridge just south of Lamont Meadows. Sometimes you have to wonder what people were thinking when naming peaks. Though I'm sure Mr. Lamont (I'm assuming it was named for a Mr. Lamont) lived a life worthy of recognition, it seems to me that his name should have been attached to nearby Sawtooth Peak, and the Sawtooth moniker given to this one. The named peak is not the highest point on the formation. This distinction belongs to either one of the pinnacles on the north ridge (don't ask me which one), or the high point on the ridge joining Lamont Peak with the the Sierra Crest, known informally as 'East Lamont Peak'. All of that notwithstanding, the Sierra Club summit register is on the named peak. It's a short, pleasant walk from Canebrake Road. On top, you are rewarded with a view of the Domelands Wilderness to the west, and the high meadows and rolling, pine-covered hills to the north and south.",
            route: "Lamont Peak Trailhead - By far the easiest way to do the peak. From the trailhead at the saddle on Canebrake Road, head east on the signed trail and follow it more or less straight up the ridge to the summit. This is not an engineered trail like the PCT. This old use trail contains only one token switchback. It can be hard to follow in places, but have faith, it is really does lead all the way to the summit area. If you think you've lost it, stop and backtrack a few yards and you're sure to pick it up again.",
